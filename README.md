Slick Picks

==

This will be the website for our Fantasy Football League. The league is currently hosted on Yahoo, but because we combine fantasy football with a football pick-em for our scoring (which itself has a custom scoring system), we end doing a lot of manual scoring.

This website will eliminate the need to manually tabulate scores every week. The site will incorporate our custom scoring and a leaderboard will automatically update every week. 

The plan is for the site to connect with the Yahoo Fantasy API to track and tabulate player and team stats.
